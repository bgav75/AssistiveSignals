High level Concept Explanation

\subsection*{Problem Enviornment}

An individual of type $X \in \X$ arrives independently according to probability distribution $\Gamma_X \in \Delta(\X)$. We need to respond with an action $Y \in \Y$ (which can be random) that then earns us a utility $U(X,Y) \in \R$. Once $X$ and $Y$ are realized the value of $U(X,Y)$ is drawn independently from $\Gamma_U(X,Y) \in \Delta(\mathbb{R}).$ In this way $\Gamma_U$ is a function on $\X \times \Y$ which determines the irreducible uncertainty in the outcomes of our problem. Our goal is to maximize our utility.

\subsection*{Decision Rule}

To determine $Y$ a decision rule $D:\X \to \Delta(\Y)$ is implemented. A decision rule captures our system's response to the problem. As utility-maximizer we hope to take an action from,
$$\Y^*_X = \arg\max_Y \E[U(X,Y)|X].$$
Thus, when evaluating a decision rule, we can focus on minimizing the deviations taken from this optimal set. This gives us the expected loss function for a decision rule $D$,
$$L(D) = \E[U(X,Y^*(X)) - U(X,D(X))],$$
where $Y^*(X) \in \Y^*_X$. Regardless of whether we have direct control over the formation of $D$, we want to take actions to minimize $L(D).$

\subsection*{Decision Maker}

The decision-maker is the creator of the decision rule. They earn a utility of,
$$V(X,Y) = U(X,Y) + \delta(X,Y).$$
In this way $\delta$ exactly encodes the deviations between our utility and the decision maker's utility. If $\delta = 0$, we say we are in control of the decision (as the decision maker acts exactly as we would want them to).
